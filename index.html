          <h2>Welcome to Deep Ocean Battles</h2>
          <p>
            This is a mini strategic browser game that is PVE. prior to the start of the game, player needs to construct the battleship frontline by dropping different ship (blocks) into the ocean (board). Hint: computer ships are generated at random locations but the patterns are the same as player's.
          </p>
          <p>
            After all ships are deployed, player shall start the game. It will take turns for the player and computer to choose the location on the ocean where they want to launch attack. If any compartment of the opponent's ship is hit, the compartment will show up, you will be given a "small" favor to gain a new turn when you hit a target. Nice?
          </p>
          <p>
            When all compartments of a ship get hit, the ship is sunk. When all your opponent's ships get sunk, woohoo, congrats you have won the game!
          </p>
